# Vote for jeezy [EU]

I will candidate for the 2020/S04 Komodo Notary Elections with my single EU node. This node has been maintained smooth and stable over the years. It is running since the very beginning of Komodo in 2015/2016. When time allows I try to help the Komodo community were possible thru setting up testservers, debugging or just answering questions.
